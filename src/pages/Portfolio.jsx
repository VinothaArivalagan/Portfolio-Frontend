    <h2>SECOND LIFE PRODUCTS</h2>
    <p>For my project, I developed a full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). 
        The front-end is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
        The backend is a REST API built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, which communicates with the React app. The application includes
         four models, with one user model. It features sign-up, log-in, and log-out functionality, with encrypted passwords and authorization. 
         Additionally, it supports social login. The entire application was deployed on Netlify, showcasing seamless integration between the 
         front-end and back-end, and demonstrating a comprehensive full-stack development approach.</p>

    <h2>Online Baking Workshop</h2>
    <p>It is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React, consisting of multiple views. This project is a web application 
        designed for users to explore and enroll in a collection of online courses. The front-end is highly interactive and user-friendly, 
        allowing users to navigate through various courses, view detailed information, and manage their enrollments seamlessly. 
        The application showcases my ability to develop dynamic and responsive web applications with React, emphasizing user experience 
        and efficient data handling.</p>

    <h3>Tap Monkey!</h3>
    <p>I developed a funny, exciting, and interactive monkey game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game is designed to keep players 
        focused and engaged. I leveraged JavaScript for the game logic, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience. As a testament 
        to my frontend development skills, this project showcases my creativity and problem-solving abilities in creating a fun and 
        educational gaming experience.</p>
