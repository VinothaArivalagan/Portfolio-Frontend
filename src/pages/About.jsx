            <h1> About Me!</h1>
            <p> My name is Vinotha, and I am currently seeking a Junior Full Stack Developer or Web Developer role. 
                I have two years of experience as a Front-End Developer in India. After moving to the Netherlands a year ago, 
                I completed an intensive Web Development course last month.
                Although I have a career gap, I am eager to leverage my skills and experience in a new role. 
                I am confident that my background in front-end development, combined with my recent training in full-stack development, 
                makes me a strong candidate.
                I would be thrilled to discuss how my skills and background align with your team's needs. 
                Please feel free to contact me at +31 617245241 or via email at vinothag96@gmail.com.
                Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further.</p>
